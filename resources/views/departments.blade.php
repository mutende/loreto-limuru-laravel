            <hr>
            <p>The Loreto High School Guidance and Counselling department aims to deliver a counseling program that promotes student academic achievement, their social and spiritual growth and identification/ awareness and development of their talents and skills.Our guiding principles are grounded in Biblical values and are therefore Christian based. Our core functions support the school&rsquo;s mission to produce women of integrity who will be agents of positive change in the global society. Our focus which primarily is on the student, is two-pronged, that is, continuous improvement in the services we offer our students and the students own performance in and out of class.</p>
        <h5>Structure</h5>
        <p>School counselors play an important role in supporting student achievement in all areas of their school life and work towards the overall harmony in an institution. In the department we have eight Teacher Counselors, all members of the teaching staff, who are headed by a Senior Head of Department and a Head of Department. They are as follows:</p>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>There are two Teacher Counselors responsible for each form. Our institution currently is five streamed in forms 2, 3, and 4 while form 1 is 6 streamed. In each of these classes there are 4 Peer Counsellors giving us a total of 84 Peer Counselors. This number will grow as the student population increases. Our Peer Counselors have two Patrons, Mrs. Mbogo and Mrs. Riika.</p>

        <h5>Activities</h5>
    <p>The department organizes group sessions in the various classes (about 2 per term), workshops for the students, video and or audio presentations, brief talks at school assemblies and invite resource persons for issues that affect the youth in the 21st Century like drug and substance abuse, use of social media, relationships among others and motivational talks. One on one counseling as well as group counseling activities run continuously throughout a school term as need arises. Special cases are referred to professional Counselors outside of the school setting.</p> <p>The department is responsible for the induction of form one students. This major activity takes place as soon the students are admitted into the school and runs for three days. Our Peer Counselors are taken through an annual 3-day seminar on Counselling skills where topics like critical thinking, teamwork and collaboration, self-awareness and discovery are also covered. The Peer Counselors attend externally organized workshop/seminar at least once a year. Their activities also include one on one sessions with their peers, brief sharing on issues affecting their classes during class meetings and school assemblies and posting of relevant literature on class and school notice boards. The Teacher Counselors take part in both internally and externally organized workshops and seminars.</p>
    <h5>Group Discussions</h5>
        <p>We encourage our students to develop positive attitudes that will enable them form meaningful relationships in all aspects of their lives now and in their future and excel in the global society.

            <p>Loreto Limuru opened its doors in 1936 with seven girls. With time, it has grown from a one stream school to six streams in form one and five streams in forms two, three and four. The school is shy of 1200 students who are housed in ten dormitories. Among the dormitories, there still stand two of them that reminds us of 1936; Haiti, and Rusinga. Each dormitory has a dorm mistress to oversee the welfare of the students.</p>
            <p>Being a national school, we receive students from all over the country and the boarding team ensures that the girls live in harmony and cohesion. The dormitories were named after famous islands. Plans are underway to name them after its founders. We thank the entire Loreto Limuru parents&rsquo; body for providing their daughters with personal effects so as to make their stay in school comfortable.<br /> God bless Loreto Limuru.<br /><br /> The dorm mistresses incharge of each dormitory are:</p>

            <hr>
            <p>In conformity with the policy of the Ministry of Education Science and Technology to award schools in non-academic areas, Loreto High school Limuru has taken the centre stage in achieving this. This school has 20 active clubs, 4 movements and 6 societies. The programme has Wednesdays from 4.10 to 5.10 pm set aside for club activities and meetings. This is when club meetings are held under the guidance and supervision of various patrons. All the students are encouraged to join at least one club and one society based on their interest so that they can nurture their talents and interests which will serve to elevate them to their rightful places in after-school life and set them on the path of success, fulfilment and happiness.</p>
<p>However, in doing this, strict observance of the school rules, the laws of the land and the societal moral expectations will and must be adhered to at all times to ensure that the school remains a safe and conducive place for learning and growth, and that at the end of it all, the students become responsible citizens who will take Kenya to the next level of glory and success.</p>
<p>The main aims of the clubs and societies include: To educate, stimulate thinking, do research for knowledge and information, to entertain, to develop creativity, render services to oneself and society, provide an avenue for socialization, help students grow spiritually and morally upright, and to help students develop and exploit their gifts and talents.</p>
<p>In clubs such as Science congress, drama, Music, debate and many more patrons have found it easy to nature and guide students in core-curricular activities. Our school has continuously excelled exemplarily well in club related competitions. It is the departments aim to build an economic, political, just and cohesive society with social equity in a clean and secure environment in line with the vision 2030 pillars.</p>
