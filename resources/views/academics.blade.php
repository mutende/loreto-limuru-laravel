                    <h5>Curriculum Delivery Policy</h5>
                    <p>Our school follows the KNEC (Kenya National Examination Council) and KICD (Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development) approved syllabus under the 8.4.4 system of education. The teachers are key players in facilitating the learning of mathematics. We recognize that mathematics opens career paths and development, since it is a key subject to most careers. We prepare students to be effective in calculation skills, so as to fit in the larger world, which is now a global village.</p>
                    <p>We focus on being role models to our students and supporting them to ensure that we produce great results every year. Our students participate in various mathematics competitions, like maths contests organised by different schools, Kenya maths Olympiad organised by Nairobi University. This is in recognition that various students learn in different ways, thus we expose them to various learning activities like, drawing graphs daily, construction skills, calculation skills, use of the mathematics tables. Students have group discussions, have a note book where they write down all formulas learnt.</p>
                    <h5>Lesson Distribution</h5>
                    <ul class="fa-ul">
                    <li>The lessons are distributed among all the members, whereby forms 1 and 2 have 6 lessons per week.</li>
                    <li>Forms 3 and 4 have 7 lessons per week.</li>
                    <li>Each lesson is forty minutes long.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Schemes of Work</h5>
                    <ul class="fa-ul">
                    <li>Schemes of work are an important tool in the teaching/learning process.</li>
                    <li>Mathematics teachers prepare the schemes of work at the beginning of each year.</li>
                    <li>Schemes of work are prepared in compliance with the syllabus.</li>
                    <li>Each teacher is given copies of the scheme that guide them in their lesson preparation and teaching.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Syllabus Coverage</h5>
                    <p>The department makes sure that there is timely coverage of the syllabus within the stipulated timelines. This helps to make sure that all that the learners are supposed to be taught is covered. After syllabus coverage, teachers embark on revision.</p>
                    <h5>Lesson Plan</h5>
                    <ul class="fa-ul">
                    <li>The department acknowledges that a lesson plan is a key guide for running a particular lesson, and it includes the goal, how and whether the goal was achieved.</li>
                    <li>The department has a policy that each lesson should be taught with the guidance of a lesson plan, for effective delivery</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Testing Policy</h5>
                    <ul class="fa-ul">
                    <li>A test or an examination is an assessment intended to measure a learner&rsquo;s knowledge, skills and aptitudes.</li>
                    <li>The Mathematics department recognizes that assignments and exercises are very essential in the learning of mathematics. As such, an assignment is given at the end of every lesson.</li>
                    <li>The department usually offers Random Assessment Test (RATs) to evaluate how much the learners have learnt.</li>
                    <li>The department identifies and supports gifted and talented learners, as well as those who fail to meet their targets.</li>
                    <li>The department keeps systematic records of each learner&rsquo;s development and achievement, to provide evidence of progress over time.</li>
                    <li>There are two Continuous Assessment Tests in a term, and one main termly exam, which further give feedback on the learner&rsquo;s academic progress.</li>

                    <li>The department does a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and targets) analysis after every test. This allows the departmental members to know whether the set targets were met or not.</li>
                    <li>If the targets were not satisfactorily met, the individual subject teacher is required to come up with a makeup test that majorly evaluates on the areas that are challenging to the learners.</li>
                    <li>There is a programme that is put in place giving extra contact hours to the weak students with an aim of solving the challenges that they may have.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>KCSE Analysis</h5>
                    <p>Upon the release of the K.C.S.E results, the departmental members meet and do an analysis of the students&rsquo; performance. A comparison is made regarding the general performance nationally. This gives direction on whether the set targets were achieved and gives the direction on the setting of the following year&rsquo;s targets. The K.C.S.E results also give a feedback on what areas need to be improved on as well as the working techniques that can be put in place to achieve the set goals.</p>
                    <h5>Highlights</h5>
                    <p>The department has produced the highest number of straight grade As in the K.C.S.E for the last 3 years.</p>

Students have group discussions, have a note book where they write down all formulas learnt. We recognize that language teachers are key players in facilitating the learning of language. We recognize that language opens career paths and development, since it is a key communication tool in every career. We also recognize that since language is central to learning the other subjects, all teachers are, in practice, language teachers, with responsibilities in facilitating communication. In this regard, we ensure that we facilitate the access to reading materials as well as other materials that enhance and develop listening, writing, reading and speaking skills in learners e.g ICT, newspapers, class readers.</p>
                <p>In liaison with the KICD, the department seeks to promote the usage of Kenya&rsquo;s official languages (English and Kiswahili) to enhance national unity. Furthermore, the school allows the usage of French for students who take it as a subject. We prepare students to be effective communicators, so as to fit in the larger world, which is now a global village. The department is made up of the following members of staff, who play a critical role in curriculum delivery. Our students participate in various essay writing competitions, like the EAC and the Commonwealth competitions. This is in recognition that various students learn in different ways, thus we expose them to various learning activities like drama, note making, creative writing, debates, individual group presentations and peer review groups. Students also recite verses in these languages.</p>

In form 2 second term, students are supposed to choose one of the two technical subjects that they took in form 1. The subject they take should be one that they have passion and perform best. Music, computer studies, art &amp; design and French have fewer students compared to the other three subjects because they require talent and creativity. By and large technical department is very dynamic contributing greatly to the overall performance of the School Mean. The department has a workforce of nine teachers namely:<br /> <br /></p>

                <p>It is with great pleasure that we welcome you to the science Department &ndash; Loreto High School, Limuru. The Department is an exciting place to be. This department has 3 subjects on offer: Biology, Physics and Chemistry. As per our academic curriculum, chemistry is offered as the compulsory central science while students have the option to take either Biology or Chemistry or both. It&rsquo;s amazing that majority of students at Loreto High School, Limuru opt for three sciences. The fact that a good number of our alumni occupy strategic positions in science oriented industries and organizations is testimony to the quality of training we deliver. We have a team of passionate, highly skilled and committed staff always ready to provide a ladder for any student yearning to move to the next level.</p>
                <h5>Resources:</h5>
                <p>We boast of six well equipped spacious science laboratories. Each of the three subjects has 2 laboratories dedicated to it. The laboratories are equipped with projectors and internet connectivity to allow for real time reference and research as well as ICT integrated pedagogy. We are one of the few schools with an open-door policy when it comes to utility of the laboratories: students are allowed to explore scientific concepts at their free time with as less supervision as possible. This has gone a long way in instilling personal discipline and self belief in the science world among the learners. The teachers have the cyberschool app installed in their laptops to facilitate curriculum delivery. This app is also available for students as a revision and learning tool.</p>
                <h5>Staff</h5>
                <p>The department prides itself of having a rich blend of professionals: our diversity in terms of gender, age, experience and locus provides learners with multifaceted avenues of learning. This diversity not only enriches our competence and expertise as teachers, but also ensures that we cater for the learning profiles of each and every learner. <br />Here are some of our staff;</p>

                <h5>Curriculum Implementation</h5>
                <p>In the science department we acknowledge that our learners have multiple intelligences &ndash; a resource that we have strategically tapped into. We reckon that there is no &ldquo;one-size-fits-all&rdquo; curriculum. We try our best to get to the level our learners and design instructional methodologies that will ensure &ldquo;no child is left behind&rdquo;. We provide various avenues through which students can learn the same thing. Our hold on differentiated instruction as a tool for learning is almost unparalleled. Our teachers are known to hold each student by the hand while providing ample environment for incubation &ndash; for the larva to metamorphose into an adult.</p>
                <p>The values and traditions we instill in our students seem never to have failed them &ndash; what with so many of them being leaders in industries and scientific world. We have tailor-made several programs that ensure continuous learning at individualized pace. In our own unique ways we inculcate a sense of academic pride and confidence in our learners &ndash; no wonder it is easier to pass than to fail in a science when you step into the science theatre that is Loreto Limuru.</p>
                <h5>Assessment Policy</h5>
                <p>Our formative evaluation policies ensure that our students face their summative assessment at the end of four years when they are well fermented. We train the girls right from form one on how to revise. The monitoring thereafter ensures that revision is a continuous process. The assessment methodologies available ensure that learners have various ways through which they can assess their learning. From written assessment, open book exams, practicals, term papers to project reports &ndash; just name it. They have it all here. Our exams are set, moderated and marked using the conveyor belt system &ndash; as done by the national assessor, KNEC. This ensures standardization of marking and also provides avenues for teachers to share their assessment strategies and learn from each other.</p>
                <h5>Academic Performance</h5>
                <p>It is not a secrete any more &ndash; we are the national leader in sciences. For over a decade now, we have topped the national charts in the sciences on several occasions. Almost every year, at least one of our subjects appears in the top 3 positions nationally. The number of students getting admissions to prime science courses every year is testimony to how well we &ldquo;bake our buns&rdquo;! Moreover, we go out of our way to link with our graduates and find their academic journeys in and off campuses and the feedback has been rewarding and satisfying.</p>
